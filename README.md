# Chess-Openings
Chess openings visualizer

Ok, so the idea is to transform this wikipedia data (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chess_openings) into a fully functional website where you can interact with a chess board and acess the name of different openings through the board or though some user interface like a form.

Let's use python to edit the text into json format, then create a node server for the api and a react app as the user interface.

This project will be separated in three distinct ramifications:

1. build a json file with python and launch it to mongodb
2. build the api with node and express
3. build the user interface with react

Then, the following steps:

1. lanch the server with... ?
2. launch the react app with github pages

And there you go.
